# ElevenLabs Static Noise Investigation Findings

## Summary
The ElevenLabs test calls are experiencing static noise issues. After implementing the official working example from ElevenLabs GitHub repository, the following issues were identified:

## Test Results

### Working Example Implementation
- Successfully adapted the official ElevenLabs example: https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/blob/main/examples/conversational-ai/twilio/javascript/outbound.js
- Call connects successfully
- WebSocket connections establish properly between Twilio and ElevenLabs
- Initial configuration is sent correctly
- Audio streaming appears to work (agent response is logged)

### Issues Identified

1. **Static Noise Instead of Clear Audio**
   - Despite successful connection and data flow, the audio output is static noise
   - The agent's initial message "Hello! This is a test call. Can you hear me clearly?" is logged but not heard clearly

2. **Call Duration**
   - Calls end quickly (within seconds)
   - The "stop" event is received shortly after the initial message
   - This could indicate an audio format mismatch or encoding issue

3. **Key Differences from Current Implementation**
   - The working example uses a simpler approach with direct WebSocket message passing
   - Audio chunks are passed through with minimal processing
   - Uses `Buffer.from(audioBase64, 'base64').toString('base64')` for normalization

## Potential Root Causes

1. **Audio Format Mismatch**
   - Twilio uses mulaw 8000Hz by default
   - ElevenLabs might expect a different format
   - The audio encoding/decoding process might be corrupting the data

2. **WebSocket Message Format**
   - The message structure for audio chunks might be incorrect
   - The timing of audio packet delivery could be off

3. **Missing Audio Processing**
   - The current implementation might need additional audio processing or buffering
   - Sample rate conversion might be required

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Audio Format Requirements**
   - Check ElevenLabs documentation for expected audio format
   - Ensure Twilio is configured to send the correct format

2. **Debug Audio Data**
   - Log the actual audio data being sent/received
   - Compare with known working implementations

3. **Test Different Audio Encodings**
   - Try different audio formats in Twilio Stream configuration
   - Experiment with audio transcoding

4. **Contact Support**
   - If issue persists, may need to contact ElevenLabs support with specific error details
   - Check if there are any known issues with the Conversational AI API

## Test Script Location
The working example adaptation is saved as: `test-elevenlabs-working.js`

## Logs
Full test logs show successful connection but audio quality issues:
- WebSocket connections establish correctly
- Initial configuration is sent and acknowledged
- Agent response is generated but audio is static
- Call terminates shortly after initial message
