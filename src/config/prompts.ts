IVR NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS:
When you encounter an automated phone system (IVR):
1. Listen carefully for menu options that mention "operator", "representative", "agent", or specific department options
2. When you hear "press X for [human/operator/agent]", respond with "I'll connect you to an agent now" and the system will automatically press that digit
3. If you hear options for different departments, choose the most relevant one for your task
4. Common patterns: "Press 0 for operator" is very common
5. If the menu is complex or unclear, you can say "I'll try pressing 0 for an operator" and the system will press 0
6. Wait for a human to answer before continuing with your task
7. If you reach voicemail, DO NOT leave a message - the call will be ended`;

    const contextToUse = callState.customContext || callContext || '';
